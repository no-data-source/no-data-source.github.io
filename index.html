<h1>NoDS</h1>
<p>Discord server: <a href="https://discord.gg/vnE9rZ2V">https://discord.gg/vnE9rZ2V</a></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>NoDS stands for no data source. This open-source application should provide unified data access.</p>
<p>This is planned as a service that can work on local servers or on the cloud. The purpose is to create a single-entry point for all developers and DevOps. It has metadata management abilities like Collibra. Solution for two big and critical problems for organizations. There are a lot of different databases, data sources, lakes, and marts. Most of them are just data swamps because they just got lost at some point. Those organizations have billions of data access rules and very complicated processes. With NoDS, some of those complications will disappear such as having twenty different connection strings to multiple data locations.</p>
<p>Since this is the single point of entry for all data within an organization, it will also provide data source statistics. Because of this, some companies can charge their internal departments or just can drop unused data sources.</p>
<p>Metadata management will provide a data catalog with permissions, comments, and dataset versions. Due to increased security, all the access logs will be visible from one location.</p>

<h2>Flow</h2>
<p>Admin adds a new data source to NoDS as a table on a website with a data owner. Gets the metadata if available. Then admin should decide if row-level security is needed for this data source. If yes, Admin needs to choose which column is the decider. This extra column should be user or group id. The next step is column selection. Who can see which column? Once everything is ready, the admin will click publish data source button, and the data set will be publicly available for several data access methods such as JDBC.</p>
<p>Once there is a request for big data files, the Livy server will trigger spark jobs. Once the data is ready, it will be shipped to the client. On this part, JDBC might be expensive, but the rest API works fine.</p>
<p>Also, if row-level security is enabled, and if there are some data without user/group id, these data will be logged as an exception and won&rsquo;t be visible until it has been decided by the data owner.</p>
<p>Also, from this website users should be able to see which datasets are available and should be able to request access from it.</p>

<h2>Sample scenarios</h2>
<p>Dev1 would like to use Kafka but doesn&rsquo;t want to deal with configurations and permissions. So, instead of using a producer, Dev1 directly sends an insert command via JDBC.</p>
<p>Company1 would like to have 2 different databases (Ms. SQL in prod, MySQL in dev) but doesn&rsquo;t want to deal with configurations, security settings, and so on. Instead, the Company1 DevOps guys add those 2 databases into NoDS, and then, they manage their permissions and details only on the NoDS part. Developers of Company1 access those databases directly with one JDBC connection.</p>
<p>DevOps1 creates a table on MS SQL and another table on MongoDB. &nbsp;Then it gives only one JDBC connection string for both tables. The only difference is table names. So, NoDS keeps track of which table belongs to which engine and makes appropriate calls. Dev2 only needs to check table names. If Dev2 has permission to see those tables, the results will be fine. But if the permission is not valid, the result set will be empty.</p>
<p>Devops2 has a problem with replication because data should be copied to several different database technologies. Migrators or auto movers require maintenance and time. NoDS can insert into several databases at the same time. So, there is no waiting time due.</p>
